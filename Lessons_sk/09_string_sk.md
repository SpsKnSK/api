# String, reťazce, slová

```py
text='text'
print(text[3])   # vypíšeme 4. znak zo stringu
print(text[1:])  # vypíšeme reťazec od 2. znaku
print(text[:4])  # vypíšeme reťazec do 4. znaku
print(text[1:len(text)]) #vypíšeme reťazec od 2. znaku po koniec
```

- `.lower()` - malé písmená
- `.upper()` - veľké písmená
- `.replace('s', 'a')` – písmeno 's' nahradí 'a'ckom
- `.split()` – rozdelí reťazec podľa nejakého znaku, základ medzera
- `.index('znak')` – vráti prvú pozíciu znaku
- `.count('znak')` – vráti počet znakov v reťazci
- `len()` – vráti dĺžku reťazca

## `.lower()`
```py
text: str = "Pista elment a Tescoba."
textWithLower: str = text.lower()
print(f"{text}\n{textWithLower}")
```

## `.upper()`
```py
text: str = "Pista elment a Tescoba."
textWithLower: str = text.upper()
print(f"{text}\n{textWithLower}")
```

## `.replace(from, to)`
```py
text: str = "Sps KN"
replacedText: str = text.replace("KN", "BA")
print(f"{text}\n{replacedText}")
```
```
Sps KN
Sps BA
```

## `.split()`
```py
text: str = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy fox."
splitText: list[str] = text.split()
print(f"{text}\n{splitText}")
```
```
The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy fox.
['The', 'quick', 'brown', 'fox', 'jumped', 'over', 'the', 'lazy', 'fox.']

## `.split()` by character
```py

## `.index(character)`
```py

```
```
They lived happily ever after.
Count of e 5

## `.count(character)`
```py
text: str = "They lived happily ever after."
print(f"{text}\nNumber of characters: {len(text)}")
```
```
They lived happily ever after.
Number of characters: 30
```

## `.join(stringCollection)`
```py
text: str = "They lived happily ever after."
collection: list[str] = text.split()
joinedString: str = "000".join(collection)
print(f"{text}\n{joinedString}")
```
```
They lived happily ever after.

## `.join(intCollection)`
```py
from random import randint

numbersString: str = ":".join([str(n) for n in numbers])
print(f"{numbers}\n{numbersString}")

```
```
[-81, 2, -10, 12, -68, 92, -90, 40, -15, 4]
