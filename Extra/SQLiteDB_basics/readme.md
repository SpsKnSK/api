## Viewing and Querying SQLite Databases in VS Code

You can easily view and query SQLite databases directly in Visual Studio Code using an extension:

1. Open the Extensions sidebar in VS Code (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).
2. Search for **SQLite** and install the extension by alexcvzz ([VSCode-SQLite](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alexcvzz.vscode-sqlite)).
3. Right-click your `.db` file in the Explorer and select **Open Database**.
4. Use the **SQLite Explorer** panel to browse tables and data.
5. To run SQL queries, create a `.sql` file, write your query, then use the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and select **SQLite: Run Query**.
