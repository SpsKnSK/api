# Programming Principles Folder Overview

This folder contains easy-to-understand explanations and examples of fundamental programming principles for beginners. The main focus is on three essential concepts:

- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** 
- **YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)**
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** 
- **SOLID Principles** A set of five important guidelines for writing better object-oriented code. Each letter stands for a principle:
  - **S**ingle Responsibility Principle: Each class should have one job.
  - **O**pen/Closed Principle: Code should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
  - **L**iskov Substitution Principle: Subclasses should be usable as their parent class.
  - **I**nterface Segregation Principle: Don't force classes to implement things they don't use.
  - **D**ependency Inversion Principle: Depend on abstractions, not concrete classes.
